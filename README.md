# PUMultiFileUploader

## Introduction

Introducing `PUMultiFileUploader`: For handling upload multiple files and for events like cancel request , pause and resume upload we would handle it through file upload manager array. There would be array of files let’s say images or it can be any docs. we would handle it through multiple files upload manager for each image or doc in the list. I have used `alamofire 5` for this upload process.

## Notes

In this demo you need to add upload `api header` data and upload `api url` to test the app.
