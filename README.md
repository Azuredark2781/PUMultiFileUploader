# PUMultiFileUploader

## Introduction

Introducing `PUMultiFileUploader`: For handling upload multiple files and for events like cancel request , pause and resume upload we would handle it through file upload manager array. There would be array of files let’s say images. we would handle it through multiple files upload manager for each image in the list. I have used `alamofire` for this upload process.
